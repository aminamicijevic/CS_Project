Dear professor,

This is my first time *ever* doing anything in Python. It took me about two months of watching several tutorials just to get the hang of it, and then I started with my project.
I know it is pretty simple, and probably can't compare with any other projects you will see this semester but I am quite proud of it. Not bad for a beginner *I hope*.
I wanted to make something that will be useful for me, my friends and future MAIA students, so I decided to make a quiz containing questions from our Medical Sensors lectures, 
so anyone who uses my project can study for the exam which is quickly approaching. I added a few different modes and some options, but everything is explained in the Instructions
of the quiz. Since I did this project completely alone, I didn't use GitHub much, but I tried my best... I would usually just forget to add changes here because I did it alone.

Overall, I am happy that I made myself go through all of this alone because I managed to learn the basics of Python and I am happy with my project :)

To start the quiz, download the folder Project and just compile the file OpeningScreen.py. 

Kind regards
